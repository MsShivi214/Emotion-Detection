# Emotion Detection System

A friendly emotion detection system that analyzes text to identify emotions (happy, sad, angry) using natural language processing and machine learning.

## 🌟 Features

- 🤖 Human-like interaction and responses
- �� Text preprocessing with NeatText
- 🔢 TF-IDF vectorization for text analysis
- 🧠 Logistic Regression model for emotion classification
- 💾 Model persistence using joblib
- 📊 Visualization with seaborn and matplotlib
- 😊 Emoji-enhanced responses

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the demo:
```bash
python demo.py
```

## 💡 How It Works

The system uses a simple but effective approach:
1. Cleans and preprocesses input text
2. Converts text to numerical features using TF-IDF
3. Predicts emotions using a trained model
4. Provides friendly, human-like responses

## 📁 Project Structure

- `emotion_detector.py`: Core emotion detection class
- `demo.py`: Interactive demo with friendly responses
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## 🎯 Example Usage

```python
from emotion_detector import EmotionDetector

# Create detector instance
detector = EmotionDetector()

# Train the model
detector.train()

# Get emotion prediction
result = detector.predict_emotion("I'm feeling happy today!")
print(result['predicted_emotion'])
```
